This app is designed for the no-frills, hard-core workout.  This is the first interval timer you’ll see with a set up that is this fast and easy.  Your workout should be intense, not your workout set up. <br />
<br />
1. Super Simple Set up. <br />
Get to your workout in no time with a clean, simple, no-frills design.<br /><br />

2. Distinct tones that guide you through your workout. <br />
We chose clear, easy-to-distinguish tones for each portion of your workout.<br /><br />

3. Work out to music with out missing a beat. <br />
Music automatically fades, allowing you to hear interval tones.
<br /><br />
<strong>Features:</strong><br />
- Press and Drag to set Work, Rest, and Repeat.<br />
- Work Periods: 5s to 2min. Rest Periods: 0s (no rest) to 2min. Up to 40 repeats.<br />
- 10 second count down allows you to get into place before your workout starts.<br />
- Three distinct sounds to designate where you are in your workout.<br />
- Countdown tone gives warning before Work starts.<br />
- Pause your workout at any time and restart right where you left off.<br />
- Music automatically fades, allowing you to hear interval tones.<br />
