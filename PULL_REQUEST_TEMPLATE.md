# Submissions to the App Showcase

If you'd like to share your application on the PhoneGap App Showcase, please
follow this submission template to help expedite the review of your app.

## Requirements

We need to know the basics about your app. In particular:

- [ ] App name
- [ ] Your name or company name
- [ ] Your email address (we may need to contact you about your submission)
- [ ] Web address (for the app or for the app developer)
- [ ] App description (no more than a few paragraphs)
- [ ] App icon, 200px X 200px HiDPI
- [ ] App store link(s)
- [ ] At least two app screenshots (but no more than 3). You can reuse the ones you submitted to the app store(s)
- [ ] Optionally, the URL to a video (YouTube, Vimeo for example)

## Review Criteria

Further, the following is a non-exhaustive list of criteria that the PhoneGap
review team looks for in Showcase applications:

- Is it an example of great design?
- Is the app cross-platform -- meaning, is your app available on at least two of the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, or the Windows Store?
- Does it have a great star rating in the app store(s)?
- Is it an app with a relatively unique concept?
- Is the app useful or impactful?
- Does it contain some level of complexity, showing off what is possible with PhoneGap?
